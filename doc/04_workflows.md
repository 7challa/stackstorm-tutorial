# Workflows

Workflows allow us to chain actions together, implement conditional logic and branching, and 
turn actions into composable automations.

Workflows are actions too! They simply use a different `runner_type: mistral-v2`.

We'll demonstrate workflows by creating one that retrieves the NASA APOD picture URL
then posts this to Twitter.

### Create workflow action metadata

The workflow action's metadata file is just like any other action metadata file. It
has `runner_type: mistral-v2`, input parameters just like the a Python action,
and `entry_point` set to the path of workflow definition YAML file (relative to
the pack's `actions/` directory)

Edit `/opt/stackstorm/packs/tutorial/actions/nasa_apod_twitter_post.yaml` and insert
the following content:

``` yaml
---
name: nasa_apod_twitter_post
pack: tutorial
description: "Queries NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture Of the Day) API to get the link to the picture of the day, then posts that link to Twitter"
runner_type: "mistral-v2"
enabled: true
entry_point: workflows/nasa_apod_twitter_post.yaml
parameters:
  status:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: "Status message for your tweet"
```

-----------
**NOTE** 
If you're struggling and just need the answer, simply copy the file from our
answers directory:
```shell
cp /opt/stackstorm/packs/tutorial/etc/answers/actions/nasa_apod_twitter_post.yaml /opt/stackstorm/packs/tutorial/actions/nasa_apod_twitter_post.yaml
```
-----------

We need to tell StackStorm about our new action metadata file:

```shell
st2ctl reload --register-actions
```


### Create the workflow

StackStorm has several different Workflow engines including 
[ActionChain](https://docs.stackstorm.com/actionchain.html), 
[Mistral](https://docs.stackstorm.com/mistral.html),
and the upcoming [Orchestra](https://github.com/StackStorm/orchestra).
We're going to be using Mistral for this example.

In our workflow we want to call `tutorial.nasa_apod` to retrieve our image URL.
Next we'll post this as a message to twitter, with picture attached,
using the `twitter.update_status` action.

**Note** The name of the workflow within the workflow file, **MUST** be the same
as the name of the StackStorm `pack.action`:

Edit `/opt/stackstorm/packs/tutorial/actions/workflows/nasa_apod_twitter_post.yaml`

Content:

``` yaml
version: '2.0'

tutorial.nasa_apod_twitter_post:
  type: direct
  input:
    - status

  tasks:
    get_apod_url:
      action: tutorial.nasa_apod
      publish:
        apod_url: "{{ task('get_apod_url').result.result.url }}"
      on-success:
        - post_to_twitter

    post_to_twitter:
      action: twitter.update_status
      input:
        status: "{{ _.status }}"
        media:
          - "{{ _.apod_url }}"
```

-----------
**NOTE** 
If you're struggling and just need the answer, simply copy the file from our
answers directory:
```shell
cp /opt/stackstorm/packs/tutorial/etc/answers/actions/workflows/nasa_apod_twitter_post.yaml /opt/stackstorm/packs/tutorial/actions/workflows/nasa_apod_twitter_post.yaml
```
-----------

### Test

Run our action, creating a new tweet!

``` shell
st2 run tutorial.nasa_apod_twitter_post status="Check out this NASA pic:"
```
