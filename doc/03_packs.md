# Packs

Packs, short for package, are organization units that bundle together the various
extension points that StackStorm provides. In a pack you can distribute the following:

* actions
* workflows
* rules
* sensors
* triggers
* Python `requirements.txt` files
* Additional content (think Jinja templates, Ansible playbooks, etc)

Packs are just `git` repos! You can either install them with the URL to the `git` repo:

```shell
st2 pack install https://domain.tld/git/stackstorm-mycoolpack.git
```

Or, you can install a pack from the public [StackStorm exchange](https://exchange.stackstorm.org)
by name:

```shell
st2 pack install xxx
```

In this demo we're going to install the `rabbitmq` pack and configure it so
we can post a message to a Queue from StackStorm.

## Install RabbitMQ pack from exchange

First, install the `rabbitmq` pack from the public
[StackStorm exchange](https://exchange.stackstorm.org).

``` shell
st2 pack install rabbitmq
```

## Configure 

``` shell
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
sudo systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
curl -O http://127.0.0.1:15672/cli/rabbitmqadmin
sudo mv -f rabbitmqadmin /usr/bin/
sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/rabbitmqadmin

rabbitmqadmin declare exchange name=demo type=topic durable=false
rabbitmqadmin declare queue name=demoqueue
rabbitmqadmin declare binding source=demo destination=demoqueue routing_key=demokey
```

### Test out the RabbitMQ pack

```shell
st2 run rabbitmq.publish_message host=127.0.0.1 exchange=demo exchange_type=topic routing_key=demokey message="test"
```

Read from the queue to see if our message was delivered:

```shell
rabbitmqadmin get queue=demoqueue count=99
```
